# CrewCall

*Because coordinating random meetup events shouldn't feel like herding hackclubers*

## What is this?

Here's how it works: You create an event, add a bunch of potential meeting spots, and people sign up. Then, shortly before the event starts, everyone gets assigned to a specific spot with a map and directions. No more "where are we meeting again?" texts or people showing up at the wrong place. You can add multiple locations to 

## Features

- **Last-minute reveals**: Meeting spots have the option to be revealed close to event time instead of much before
- **Smart grouping**: Automatically assigns people to spots based on capacity and preferences
- **Interactive maps**: Built-in Leaflet maps with compass navigation
- **Mobile-friendly**: Works great on phones (because that's where you'll use it)
- **Simple signup**: Just name, email, and optional interests for better grouping

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite
- **UI**: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui components
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Edge Functions)
- **Maps**: Leaflet + React Leaflet
- **Deployment**: Vercel
